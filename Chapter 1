# Chapter 1

python - is a programing language

what is programing language simply when you want to talk  [ means want to run your code ] to a computer use programing language

but here even a computer cant understand the programing language 

So flow is

  code ( python )     ---->>>>>        Translator           ---->>>>>>         Machine // computer
                                   compiler / Interpreter

Pythin is Interpreter

# ------------------------------------

Python Character Set

• Letters = A to Z, a to z
• Digits = 0 to 9
• Special Symbols = + - * / etc.
• Whitespaces = Blank Space, tab, carriage return, newline, formfeed
• Other characters = Python can process all ASCIl and Unicode characters as part of data or literals


# ------------------------------------

Note -  

String // word always inside  ""

""  = for world
    = nothing for number

# ------------------------------------    

print("Hello world")      # just print hello

print = is function 
      =  use case :  Print Only


print("Hello my name is vikrant", "i'm working as SRE")

# Print number + Math

print(1)
print(2)

print(1+2)     OR    print("this is addition = ",1+2)


# ------------------------------------

########################
# Variables 
########################

Variable_Rules : 

  --  Identifiers can be combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits or an underscore(_). So my Variable, variable_1, variable_for_print all are valid python identifiers.

  --  An Identifier can not start with digit. So while variable1 is valid, 1variable is not valid.

  --  We can't use special symbols like !,#,@,%,$ etc in our Identifier.

  --  Identifier can be of any length.

# -- 

string  =  world
integer =  number
float   =  decimal value  (like 2.5 or 3.5 )
boolean =  True / False 
None    =   ex - a = None

# -- 

keywords - means reserved words in python 


means this is data type

print(type(name))      --  to check type of variable

""  = for world
    = nothing for number

name = "vikrant"
age = 27

print(name)
print(age)

print("my name is", name)

print("my name is", name, "and my age is :",age)

a = 3
b = 3

add = a + b

print(add)
print(a - b)

# Types of Operators
########################


An operator is a symbol that performs a certain operation between operands.

   • Arithmetic Operators (* , - ,*, / ,%, **)
   
   • Relational / Comparison Operators (==,!= , > , <, ≥= , ≤= )        # it Answer only on True / False 
   
   • Assignment Operators  ( = , += , -= , *= , /= , %= , **= )
       
         Basic Exp =  a = 5
                      
                       
            so, New variable
                      a += 5           Ex -   + = 5 so 5+5 10 is answer
                      a += 10          Ex -   + = 5 so 5+5+1=  = 15 is answer

   • Logical Operators ( not, and , or )        - its work on Boolean Only

   if you want to print(True) its print True but you if say like this print(not True) its print False

Not operator - Work on only one value

    Ex : a = 5
         b = 5
       
         print(not (a == b))


And operator - Work on Two Value ( means two value must be true )

   Ex :  a = 5
         b = 10
         c = 5
         d = 5

        print((a == b) and (a ==c))       # If One is False it respond False
        print((a == b) and (a ==d))       # it check both variable must be true // If not it respond False



Or Operator - must be any one True then respond True / if both False then respond False

    Ex : a = 5
         b = 10

        print((a = b) or (a < b))      - Only One is True So it Respond True

Basic Intro
  
    -  Arithmetic Operation are for Mathematical operation like sum minus divide and all ( % - for 10/5 =)

# Type Conversion
########################

type of conversion :  1) Automatical  -   Python do Automatical for use .
                      2) Casting      -   We have manually do it .

Automatic Conversion - Python do by himself

     a = 5        - integer
     b = 10.5     - float

     sum = a + b
     print(type(sum))       # sum type must be float

Casting

     a = "5"           # 5 is inside the  " " so its string not int
     b = 10.5 

     sum ( a + b)
     print(sum)          #  Error cant add string in flot
    
So change Type
    
      a = int("5")
      b = 10.5
    
     sum = a + b
     print(sum)

#Input form user 
########################

Get input from user

# Note - Defalut the Input Behaviour 
          
       what is you name = vikrant // Or // 27
       the type of vikrant // 27 is String 

       Ex - < Outout > 
            tell me your age :23
                   23
                  <class 'str'>


input("what is your_name")

# store in variable

name = input("what is your name")
print(name)

# Use the Type Conversion here


value = int(input("tell me your age :"))
valur = float(input("tell you you percentage :"))
